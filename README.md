# Hackernoon Post

**technologies used:**
- Next.js
- Tailwind + CSS Modules for styling

**Time spent:** ~4h over two days

## Goals
- [x] recreate the hackernoon layout + visual identity
- [x] render all post content correctly (gists, blockquotes, etc.)
- [x] responsiveness
- [x] basic inline emoji reactions prototype

## Out of Scope
Some features I left out due to time constraints:

- footer and related stories
- fully functional inline emoji reactions
- dark mode
